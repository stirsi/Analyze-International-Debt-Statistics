## Business problem
The leadership team at your company is making goals for 2023 and wants to
understand how much revenue each of the product subscriptions, basic and  expert ,
are generating each month. More specifically, they want to understand the
distribution of monthly revenue across the past year, 2022.

They've asked you the following questions:
1. How much revenue does each product usually generate each month?
2. Which product had the most success throughout all of last year? 
3. Did either product fluctuate greatly each month or was the month-to-month trend
fairly consistent?

Since the request is for a board meeting tomorrow, you decide that a granular report
of monthly revenue by product probably isn't the best deliverable, because a large
table of numbers isn't great for gleaning quick insights. Instead, you decide to
calculate something more high-level: the minimum, maximum, average, and
standard deviation of monthly revenue for each product for the year 2022. This will
equip leadership with a quick summary of the revenue and consistency that each
product provided last year.

With this tight of a deadline, you know you've got to get to work!

Task:
Using a CTE and the subscriptions and products tables, calculate the:

minimum monthly revenue: min_rev
maximum monthly revenue: max_rev
average monthly revenue: avg_rev
standard deviation of monthly revenue: std_dev_rev

for each product, ProductName .

Code:

with monthly_revenue as (
select p.productname, 
        sum(s.REVENUE) as mon_rev, 
        date_trunc('month', s.orderdate) as month
from products as p
    left join subscriptions as s
    on s.productid = p.productid
where s.orderdate between '2022-01-01' and '2022-12-31'
group by p.productname, month
)

select productname, 
    min (mon_rev) as min_rev,
    max(mon_rev) as max_rev,
    avg(mon_rev) as avg_rev,
    stddev(mon_rev) as std_dev_rev
from monthly_revenue
group by productname;
